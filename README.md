### What is this repository for? ###

* Quick summary

This is a seed app for quickly setting up a webapp with Node.js and Typescript. 

It is based off an early prototype of http://petscribe.com.au/ before we switched to C#/.NET Core for the backend.


### How do I get set up? ###

* Summary of set up
